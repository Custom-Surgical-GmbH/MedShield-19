## FREE 3D PRINT MODEL FOR CUSTOMIZING A SNORKELING MASK INTO A VIRUS PROTECTION MASK
The current crisis for medical supplies caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic has made us at Custom Surgical focus primarily on helping to prototype and print all the ideas from anyone involved in the healthcare domain that would help in these times.
We support the initiative of Dr. David Kohn and Dr. Cristian Mu√±iz of turning regular masks into protective masks by adding HME filters through a 3D printed extension

This repo is created so that all designer can get our designs, improve them and share new ideas. If you want to contribute, please send us an email to info@customsurgical.de

We are also looking for volunteers owning 3D printers, in order to supply doctors in different regions with attachments if they request them. To participate send us an email with the following info:
1. Your approximate location
2. Phone 
3. Contact hours
